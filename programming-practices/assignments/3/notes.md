## CPU-bound & IO-bound program:

- cpu-bound & IO-bound processes: If a process runs faster if the CPU runs faster than it is said to be cpu bound and if the process runs faster if the speed of IO system is increased then it is said to be IO-bound. 

- A process which calculates the digits of pi is an example of CPU bound process while a process which is reading file stored in disk is an example of IO bound process.

- When some process is doing both(calculations and IO operations) then the bottleneck operation(which is usually IO for most cases) will make the process IO bound or CPU bound.
