Q1. Write a bash script to print the directory tree (iterate over sub-directories as well) from a
directory given as a parameter to the script. While printing the name of the files, remove the
extension of the file. Also, count the number of files and directories.



The file **mytree.sh** is as follows.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

BRANCH_SYMBOL="└──"
DIR_COUNT=0
FILE_COUNT=0

# returns a string that represents the name of the file without extension
# $1: file name
remove_extension() {
	FILE_NAME=$(echo $1)
	REV_FILE_NAME=$(echo $1 | rev)

	for (( i=0; i<${#REV_FILE_NAME}; i++ ))
	do
		if [ "${REV_FILE_NAME:$i:1}" = "." ]
			then
				INDEX=$((i + 1))
				FILE_NAME=$(echo "${REV_FILE_NAME:$INDEX:${#FILE_NAME}}" | rev)
				break
		fi
	done

	echo $FILE_NAME
}

# prints the name of the directory or file
# $1: number of offset
# $2: name of file(not full path)
# $3 : 1 if file otherwise 0
print() {
	SPACE_LEN=$(( $1 * 4 ))
    EMPTY_STRING=$(printf %${SPACE_LEN}s)
	LINE="${EMPTY_STRING}${BRANCH_SYMBOL}"
	FILE_NAME="$2"
	if [ $3 -eq 1 ]
		then
			FILE_NAME=$(remove_extension $FILE_NAME)
	fi
	echo "${LINE}${FILE_NAME}"
}

# recursively traverses the directory and prints the name of directory and file. also calculates the total number
# of directories and files in global variables defined at the beginning of file
# $1: path to directory
# $2: number of offset
dfs() {

	for i in $(ls $1)
	do
		if [ -d "${1}/${i}" ]
			then
				(( DIR_COUNT++ ))
				print $2 "${i}" 0
				dfs "${1}/${i}" $(( $2 + 1 ))
			else
				(( FILE_COUNT++ ))
				print $2 $i 1
		fi
	done
}

# call the dfs function and pass the name of the directory given as arg. second argument represents the indentation level
dfs $1 0

# print the count of directories and files
echo
echo "${DIR_COUNT} directories, ${FILE_COUNT} files"
```



Following command is used to run the program.

```bash
 ./mytree.sh ../../../assignments
```



The output of the above script is as follows.
