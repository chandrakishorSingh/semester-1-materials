Q4. Write a program to flip a coin, it should show some animation of ASCII characters
beforeprinting the result of the coin flip and also give a beep while showing the result. To give a
beep,you need to first install beep package in your system. Use the sample output as shown
below.

The required script is as follows.

**coin.sh file:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# head face
HEAD="
 _____
/HEADS\\
\\_____/
\\|||||/
"

# tail face
TAIL="
 _____
/TAILS\\
\\_____/
\\|||||/
"

# toss the coin
DURATION=3
while [ $DURATION -ne 0 ]
do
	echo -e "$HEAD"
	echo "Tossing the coin..."
	sleep 1
	clear
	echo -e "$TAIL"
	echo "Tossing the coin..."
	sleep 1
	clear

	(( DURATION-- ))
done

# use $RANDOM to get result of toss
RESULT=$(( 1 + $RANDOM % 2 ))

# play the beep sound
beep
# print the heads/tails depending on result
echo "Result of toss is..."
if [ $RESULT -eq 1 ]; then
	echo -e "$HEAD"
	else
		echo -e "$TAIL"
fi
```



To play the "beep" sound, we need to install the beep package. I've used following command in my fedora machine to install the package.

```bash
sudo dnf install beep
```

Also, the `pcspkr` kernel module should be loaded for `beep` package to work. Following command is used to load the required kernel module.

```bash
sudo modprobe pcspkr
```

Following command is used to run the program.

```bash
./coin.sh
```



Its output is as follows.
